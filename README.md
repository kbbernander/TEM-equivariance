# TEM-equivariance

This is the code for the manuscript Classification of Viruses in Transmission Electron Microscopy Images using Equivariant Neural Networks. Provided is the code for the group-equivariant network, training on augmented BloodMNIST data. The file can be modified to use other symmetry groups, a baseline CNN, and the training, validation and test data. Also provided is the matlab script for augmenting the training data.

Python with the pytorch and e2cnn libraries are the most important prerequisites for running the code.
